* Constructor
* A class in Kotlin has a primary constructor and possibly one or more secondary constructors.
* The primary constructor is declared in the class header, and it goes after the class name and optional type parameters.
* The class header can't contain any runnable code. If you want to run some code during object creation, use initializer blocks inside the class body -> init keyword
